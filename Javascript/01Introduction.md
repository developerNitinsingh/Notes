# Introduction

### 1. Setting up environment in local machine :

> node js runs the js files  
> **Node JS, Deno JS, V8 Engine** these are the excutions engines
>
> **Node JS** is a JavaScript **runtime environment** that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser

#### To run the javascript outside of a web browser :

- Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) in your System
- After installing this you can excute any **_JavaScript_** file using  
  `node filename.js` command .

## Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is a popular programming language that is widely used to build web applications.
- It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is run by your web browser rather than
  on a server.
- JavaScript is also used to build mobile apps, create interactive documents, and build
  server-side applications with the help of runtime environments such as Node.js.

# Advantages of learning Javascript

**1. Ease of use:** JavaScript is a high level language, ehich means that it is easy to learn and use. It is also a dynamically-typed language, which means that tou don't have to specify the type of variable when you declare it, making it easy to write code quickly.

**2. Cross-plateform compatibiity :** JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, so you can use it to build web applications that will run on any device with a web browser.

**3. A large developer community :** There is a large and active community of developers who use and contribute to javascript, which means that there are many resourse availvle for learning the language and getting help when you need it.

**4. Powerfull capabilities :** Javadcript has a lot of powerful features that allow you to build complex and interactive applications. for example you can use javascript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a web page, make asynchronous network request, and work with multimedia and other types of data.  
**5. Growing demand :** The demand for javaScript developers is high and continues to grow, making it a good language to learn if you want to persue a career in software development.

# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich**, a progammer at Netscape Communication Corporation. It was originally called **Mocha**, then changed to **LiveScript**, and finally, it was given the name **JavaScript** to leverage the popularity of _JAVA_, which was a popular programming language at that time. JavaScript was first introduced in **_Netscape Navigator 2.0_**, a popular web browser of that time.

In **1996**, JavaScript was submitted to the **_Europian Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)_** and it was standardized as ECMAScript. This standardized version of javaScript is still used today and is supported by all modern web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozillla Firefox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge etc.

Is the early stage of JavaScript, it Tas primarily used for simple things like from validation and simple mouse intractions, but as browser became more powerful and web standards evolved, JavaScript became more widely used for building more complex web applications, Wit the introduction of popular libraries and frameworks like JQuery, AngularJS, React JS, and Vue JS , it has became easiar to build complex and powerful web applications using JavaSript.

The emergence of Node.js in **2009** made it possible to run JavaScript on the server side and it became more popular as a full stack language, allowing for code reuse and sharing between the client side and the server side.

# What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript (often referred to as simply "JavaScript") is a programmig language speciffication standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It was first published in 1997 and is used to create scripts for the web and after enviornments. JavaScript is the most widely-used implemention of ECMA Script and is supported by all major web browsers.

ECMAScript defines the syntax, semantics and features of the language, and specifies how it should be implemented.the specification includes things like:

- **Data types :** ECMAScript support severed several data types such as numbers, string, and objects.
- **Variables :** ECMAScript defines the way variables are declared and used.
- **Expressions and Operators :** ECMAScript specifies the operator that can be used to manipulate data and create expressions.

- **Control flow :** ECMAScript defines the various control flow statements such as if-else, for, and while loops.

- **Function :** ECMAScript defines how function are created, called, and returned.

- **Objects :** ECMAScript specifies how to create and manipulate objects, including how to define properties and methods.

# Versions of ECMAScript

ECMAScript has several versions, with the latest one being ECMAScript 2022 (ES13). Each new version of
ECMAScript adds new features and updates the existing ones. The first version was introduced in 1997 as
ECMAScript 1. In which they introduced basic JavaScript syntax and features. Major updates in JavaScript were
introduced in ECMAScript 6 (2015) and they make JavaScript a more powerful, expressive, and efficient
language, allowing developers to write more maintainable and scalable code.
